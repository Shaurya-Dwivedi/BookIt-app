## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### State Management
```typescript

const [bookingDetails, setBookingDetails] = useState(() => {
  const saved = localStorage.getItem('bookingDetails');
  return saved ? JSON.parse(saved) : defaultState;
});

// Save on change
useEffect(() => {
  localStorage.setItem('bookingDetails', JSON.stringify(bookingDetails));
}, [bookingDetails]);

// Clear after booking
localStorage.removeItem('bookingDetails');
```

### Form Validation
```typescript
// Real-time email validation
const emailRegex = /^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$/;
if (value && !emailRegex.test(value)) {
  setEmailError('Please enter a valid email address');
}

// Multiple conditions for button
disabled={isSubmitting || !agreedToTerms || !!emailError}
```

### Search Implementation
```typescript
// Filter by multiple fields
const filtered = experiences.filter((exp) =>
  exp.title.toLowerCase().includes(query.toLowerCase()) ||
  exp.location.toLowerCase().includes(query.toLowerCase()) ||
  exp.description.toLowerCase().includes(query.toLowerCase())
);
```

**3. Checkout**
> "On checkout, I can see all my selections including date, time in IST, and quantity. The email field validates in real-time - see the red border? Now it's green. I must accept the terms checkbox. The promo code gives clear success feedback."

**4. Persistence**
> "If I refresh the page now... see? All my data is still here thanks to localStorage."

**5. Booking Complete**
> "After booking, I get a confirmation reference and the cart clears automatically."
